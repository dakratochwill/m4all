He studied chemistry at the University of West Florida (B.S.), MIT (Ph.D. Advisor: Mark S. Wrighton), and UNC-Chapel Hill (Post-Doc Advisor: David Whitten). He is an Associate Professor of Chemistry at the University of Richmond where he works with undergraduate students on research projects focused in two main areas: 1) the interface of physical, analytical, and synthetic Chemistry, particularly as it applies to developing flow chemistry methods for synthesis of important API’s, and 2) energy research, in particular CO2 reduction. His work at Medicines for all focuses on developing Electrosonic Spray Ionization (ESSI) as a flow chemistry method for accelerating organic reactions and using NMR to elucidate synthesis pathways for optimizing flow syntheses of API’s, e.g. fluconazole.
