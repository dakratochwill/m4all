                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>The Medicines for All Institute (“M4ALL”) was established in July 2017 with the goal of reducing the high costs of pharmaceutical products. We are committed to Improving Access to Safe, Effective, and Affordable Medicines. With medicine prices rising, innovators and generic manufacturers have little incentive to reduce manufacturing costs for wide range of medicines.” M4ALL believes that its broad depth of novel chemical process technologies can lead to a step change reduction of excess costs. Undoubtedly, these processes expand patient access to both existing and new medication at an overall lower cost. M4ALL was formed to pursue and deliver this vision with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. <strong>Improve Access to Safe, Effective, and Affordable Medicines.</strong></p>
                <h2>Reinventing the Medicine Supply Chain</h2>
                <p>M4ALL’s manufacturing optimization process has the potential to significantly impact the pharmaceutical supply chain, and in particular, generic manufacturers. The competitive generic marketplace has tight margins and high barriers to entry for new competitors. This is especially true for manufacturers of global health treatments, where margins are typically even more constrained. M4ALL strives to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and provide technical innovation, providing several competitive advantages in an already challenging marketplace. Additionally, M4ALL’s green chemistry and reduced waste generation cuts manufacturing costs and helps meets the standard of new government regulatory demands. Our methodology also can be applied to brand, or in development treatments where there may be significant opportunities to reduce costs for a newer process and where improving accessibility becomes critically important for a novel drug. These significant economic and environmental benefits together can lower global health costs and expand patient access, while reducing manufacturing costs and waste. These benefits ensure the sustainability and vitality of the global supply chain.</p>
                <h2>Train the Next Generation</h2>
                <p>M4ALL operates under the auspices of Virginia Commonwealth University’s College of Engineering, located in Richmond, Virginia. As a research-related Institute within the university, M4ALL strives to educate and train the next generation of chemists and engineers by imparting the principles and foundations of innovative modeling that will lead to affordable, high-quality medicines. This approach allows our students and Fellows to design processes with immediate impact on global health and to expand the workforce to meet the 21st century’s needs. M4ALL is currently engaged in partnerships with research institutes in other countries to equip research scientists with skills and expertise needed to build up capabilities to produce their own medicines. This would lead to reduced dependence on a few manufacturers around the world and empower a country or region to be self-sufficient in providing high quality health care to its own people.</p>
