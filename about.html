        <h1>Our Story</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="subpage container">
        <p>The Medicines for All Institute is a global partner to developers, manufacturers, and procurers of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), a major cost driver in treating diseases around the world.</p>
        <h2>Reinventing the Medicine Supply Chain</h2>
        <p>The M4ALL manufacturing optimization process has the potential to significantly change the economics of the pharmaceutical supply chain, in particular for generic manufacturers. The generic marketplace is extremely competitive—with tight margins and high barriers to entry for new competitors. This is especially true for manufacturers of global health treatments, where margins are typically even more constrained. The M4ALL model provides not only an opportunity for manufacturers to reduce costs and increase efficiency, but it also provides technical innovation to serve as a competitive advantage in an already challenging marketplace. Additionally, M4ALL’s environmental benefits, based on green chemistry and reduced waste generation, not only reduce manufacturing costs but also reduce expenditures associated with waste disposal to help meet new government regulatory demands. These significant economic and other ancillary benefits provide a unique win-win: permitting lower global health costs and improved patient access while reducing manufacturing costs, preserving manufacturer margins, and improving manufacturers’ environmental impact. Together, these benefits ensure the sustainability and, indeed, vitality of the global supply chain.</p>
        <h2>Training the Next Generation of Global Scientists</h2>
        <p>M4ALL operates under the auspices of the Virginia Commonwealth University College of Engineering, located in Richmond, Virginia. As a research-related institute within the university, M4ALL has a responsibility to educate and train the next generation of chemists and engineers and instill the principles and foundations that will drive accessibility to affordable and high-quality medicines. This will result in work force expansion to meet the 21st century's needs in global health care. Additionally, M4ALL is currently engaged with partner countries to explore ways to develop in-country or in-region medicine manufacturing capabilities that utilize processes developed by M4ALL. One pathway is to create a program whereby chemists and engineers from a country or region are trained with the necessary skills and expertise to build up capabilities to produce their own medicines. This would lead to reduced dependence on a few manufacturers around the world and empower a country or region to be self-sufficient in providing high quality health care to its own people.</p>
